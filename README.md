# Asooda Owar Poets project
The Poets Project is a sub-project of AsahavarOwar Company.
The main goal of this project is to connect more people with poets and the context for new poems.
In this project, you can create a free account of the type of poet or singer, if you are a poet, play your poems, and if you like poetry, enjoy new poems and follow your favorite poets.
